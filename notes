Route::post('/login', [AuthController::class, 'login']);

Controller functions
“Then I create the controller method that handles the request.”

public function login(Request $request) {
    // logic here
}

Validation
“I validate the data, either directly or using a FormRequest.”
$request->validate([
  'email' => 'required|email',
  'password' => 'required'
]);

JSON response
“I return a JSON response with proper status codes.”

return response()->json(['message' => 'Login success'], 200);
(+ say you test using Postman)
